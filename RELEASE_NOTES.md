# MODDYS World Radio for iOS v1.1.0

The station list stops being a closed book on iPhone and iPad: you can add your own stations now -
a quiet ➕ Add button, a short form, and anything that streams audio joins the list.

## What changed

**Add a station.** ➕ Add - the last button in the toolbar, or just press `a` - opens a small form:
name, stream URL, format, bitrate, country, city, language, genres and website. The country field
suggests all 221 of them, the format is worked out from the address (with an override if you know
better than the URL does), and there is a short how-to under the fields for the first time you use it.
The Add and Cancel buttons stay pinned to the bottom of the form, so they are reachable without
scrolling past nine fields on a phone.

**It tells you when an address will not play, instead of adding it and leaving you with a dead card.**
A `.pls`, `.m3u` or `.xspf` playlist is refused on the spot - that is a file for a desktop player, not
a browser - and so is a DASH manifest, a web page, a missing name, and the same stream twice. Two
things are added but flagged rather than refused: an HLS address on a browser that cannot play it, and
a plain `http://` address on a secure page.

**Test stream, before you save.** It asks the station's own server what it is serving *and* lets WebKit
try to decode it - muted, so nothing announces itself out of your phone - then says what it found. A
stream server that answers HEAD requests with an error is handled too (it is asked with GET, and the
body is dropped straight away). When it cannot confirm an address it says exactly that; it never calls
something playable on a guess.

**Your stations are yours.** They live in this app's own storage, are searchable and filterable along
with everything else, can be starred, played and removed (✕ on the card, or Remove in its details),
and they are never uploaded anywhere. No account, same as the rest of the app.

**A station you just added is never lost in the list.** It goes to the top, the search box is put back
to empty for it, and if a filter - or the Verified switch - would still hide it, the app says so and
offers the one tap that shows it.

**Nothing else moved.** The mini player, the docking and resizing, the hand-over, the toolbar's four
bars, the count and the pager are exactly as they were.

**The bundled page is the current one**, byte for byte - the same file Android 1.7.0 carries.

## Verified

- the suite that drives the real page, against this page: 239 checks, 0 failed
- the same suite against what moddys.net serves: 239 checks, 0 failed
- the add-a-station suite (new with this release): 60 checks, 0 failed in Chromium and 60 in WebKit -
  WebKit is the engine this app actually uses - and 59 against the live site, where the one check that
  needs a same-origin audio file is skipped and says so
- the layout sweep over 14 device shapes (Android 320 / 360 / 412, landscape, 800 tablet; iPhone
  SE / 15 / 15 Pro Max; iPad mini / Pro; macOS 1280 / 1440; Windows 1366 / 1920): 14 measured,
  0 broken
- `tools/shim_harness.py --only ios` drives the real shell over the iOS bridge: 32 checks, 0 failed
- the downloads suite: 84 checks, 0 failed, and the live feed checks against the file and its sha256
- the bundled `index.html` is byte-identical to the one this release puts on the site
  (sha256 `8b842489ac5d8141ac3927718057e525`), and `scripts/verify_bundle.py` reads that out of the
  published `.app` itself rather than off a build log

## Install

Sideload the unsigned `.ipa` with Sideloadly (or an on-device signer) and your own Apple ID - see the
download page for the two steps. Your stations and favourites stay, including the ones you added by
hand.

## Cheers Moddy !
